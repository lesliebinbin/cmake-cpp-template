* Notes
** Already Integrate Build Tools Conan
   - Whenever a new package has been added, remember to invoke
   #+BEGIN_SRC shell
    cd build
    conan install ..
   #+END_SRC
   - By default conan download the packages build from gcc or g++, if your cmake
     use clang to build, invoke the command
    #+BEGIN_SRC shell
      cd build
      conan install --profile clang ..
    #+END_SRC
     the profile is locate within directory $HOME/.conan/profiles, in the
     example above the profile is *clang*
    a profile example is as below
   #+begin_example
     [settings]
     compiler=clang
     os=Linux
     os_build=Linux
     arch=x86_64
     arch_build=x86_64
     compiler.libcxx=libstdc++11
     compiler.version=10

     [env]
     CC=/usr/bin/clang
     CXX=/usr/bin/clang++
   #+end_example

** When Conan Install Failed With Wired Authentication Reason,
   - This is mostly due to .netrc file when git pull it will pass your auth, but
     some fucking repo just fail if you carry with your auth, so temporary move
     .netrc to .netrc-backup, and when download finish, move .netrc-backup to .netrc

** Quick fix
for clang++ cross compile We need
/usr/arm-linux-gnueabi/include/c++/9/arm-linux-gnueabi -I /usr/arm-linux-gnueabi/include
